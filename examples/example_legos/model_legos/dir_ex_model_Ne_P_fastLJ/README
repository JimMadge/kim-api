This directory (ex_model_Ne_P_fastLJ) contains a shifted Lennard-Jones (LJ) pair
potential Model for Neon written in C.  It complies with the KIM API interface
standard, using any NBC, iterator mode, publishes its parameters, and supports
optional computation of `energy', `forces', `particleEnergy', and
`process_dEdr'.  The Model is optimized for speed and specifically for the case
where `energy' and `forces' are the only quantities to be computed.

The contents of the directory are as follows (before any compilation is
performed):
