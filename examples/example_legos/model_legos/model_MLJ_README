This directory (MODEL_NAME_STR) contains a modified Lennard Jones (LJ) Model
with smoothed cutoff radius written in LANGUAGE_STR.  It complies with the KIM
API library, using the NBC_NAME_STR NBC and locator mode, and publishes its
parameters, and supports optional computation of `energy', `forces',
`particleEnergy', and `virial'.
