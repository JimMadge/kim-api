***  Description of the example Model Drivers  ***

A description of the provided example Model Drivers is given below.

ex_model_driver_P_LJ (Fortran 2003)
     This Model Driver is based on the template file
     ${KD}/DOCs/TEMPLATEs/model_driver_P_Template.F03.  Thus, it is useful
     to compare the file ex_model_driver_P_LJ.F03 with
     ${KD}/DOCs/TEMPLATEs/model_driver_P_Template.F03 to see the relatively
     few changes required to implement the shifted Lennard-Jones Model Driver.
     The template implements all NBCs and Iterator and Locator modes in a way
     that results in a very compact compute() function.

ex_model_driver_P_Morse (C)
     This Model Driver is based on the template file
     ${KD}/DOCs/TEMPLATEs/model_driver_P_Template.c.  Thus, it is useful to
     compare the file ex_model_driver_P_Morse.c with
     ${KD}/DOCs/TEMPLATEs/model_driver_P_Template.c to see the relatively
     few changes required to implement the shifted Morse Model Driver.  The
     template implements all NBCs and Iterator and Locator modes in a way that
     results in a very compact compute() function.
