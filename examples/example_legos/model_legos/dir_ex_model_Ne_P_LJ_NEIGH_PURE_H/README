This directory (ex_model_Ne_P_LJ_NEIGH_PURE_H) contains a Lennard Jones (LJ)
Model for neon with a discontinuous cutoff radius written in FORTRAN.  It
complies with the KIM API interface standard, using the NEIGH_PURE_H NBC and
iterator mode, and supports optional computation of `energy', `forces' and
`particleEnergy'.

The contents of the directory are as follows (before any compilation if
performed):
