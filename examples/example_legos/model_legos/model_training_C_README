This directory (MODEL_NAME_STR) contains a shifted Morse pair potential
Model written in C.

   phi(r) = epsilon * ( - exp[ -2*C*(r - Rzero) ] + 2*exp[ -C*(r - Rzero) ] )
            + shift

where shift is computed so that phi(rcut) = 0.0

It complies with the KIM API interface standard, using these NBCs:
  CLUSTER
  NEIGH_PURE_H
  NEIGH_PURE_F
  NEIGH_RVEC_H
  NEIGH_RVEC_F
  MI_OPBC_H
  MI_OPBC_F
It supports:
  iterator mode
  locator mode
It supports the arguments:
  optional computation of `energy', `forces', `particleEnergy'
  `virial', `particleVirial', and 'hessian'
  `process_dEdr' and `process_dE2dr2' (-> also: virial, particleVirial, hessian)
It publishes its parameters.
It supports flexible units.
It uses the Model Buffer for efficiency.
