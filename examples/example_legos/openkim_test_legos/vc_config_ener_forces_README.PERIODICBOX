This directory (vc_config_ener_forces) contains a Verification Check that
computes the energy and forces for a read-in isolated uster and compares them
with the expected results in the input file.

Calling format:

   ./vc_config_ener_forces

and enter model name and then data file (see format below).

Notes:

1. It generates its own KIM descriptor file in a string and uses
   kim_api_string_init to set up the KIM object.

2. It figures out which species a Model supports using
   KIM_API_get_model_partcl_typs.

3. The code supports the following NBCs:

        NEIGH_RVEC_H
        NEIGH_PURE_H
        NEIGH_RVEC_F
        NEIGH_PURE_F
        MI_OPBC_H
        MI_OPBC_F
        CLUSTER

   The code runs in sequence over all NBCs supported by the Model (from the
   above list).

4. The configuration is read in the following format:

STRUCTURE OF ATOMIC CONFIGURATION FILE

The file containing the particle configuration, energy and forces must have the
following format:

N                                   Number of particles

BoxSize_x BoxSize_y BoxSize_z       The x, y and z lengths of the orthogonal
                                    periodic simulation box.  Since minimum
                                    image conventions are used when applying
                                    PBCs, the simulation box length along each
                                    direction must be at least twice the cutoff
                                    radius of the interatomic model.  For non-
                                    periodic boundary conditions in a given
                                    direction, increase the periodic length
                                    such that it is at least greater than the
                                    maximum distance between particles along
                                    that direction plus the cutoff radius of
