# usage: run_forces_numer_deriv_for_all_models
#
# This script runs the vc_forces_numer_deriv executable for each Model in the
# MODELS directory.  It filters the output so that, for each Model, the Model
# name is printed and followed by a list of supported NBC methods and the
# associated "alpha" value computed by the vc_forces_numer_deriv computation.
# This provides a convenient summary of the results.
