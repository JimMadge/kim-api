This directory (LennardJones612_Ar) contains a Lennard-Jones model defined for
Ar.

* Sigma parameter is set to (2^{-1/6})*r_0, where r_0 is the atomic covalent
  radius.  The covalent radius was taken from Wolfram Mathematica's
  `ElementData["CovalentRadius"]' command.

* Epsilon parameter is set to the bond dissociation energy.  The bond
  dissociation energy was taken from the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics,
  91st Edition, Ed. W.H. Haynes, 2010. (as posted here:
  http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~luo971/2010-91-CRC-BDEs-Tables.pdf)

* Cutoff parameter is set to 4.0*sigma.  This corresponds to a cutoff energy
  of approximately epsilon/1024.
