This directory (examples) contains directories with example Model Drivers,
Models, Simulators, and OpenKIM Tests that can be compiled as part of the KIM
API package.  Use `make examples' from the main directory in order to build
the provided examples.

This directory is populated with the provided examples as part of the KIM API
distribution.  Please see the README files within each directory for
information about the examples.

To build and install these examples:

First you must create the file Makefile.KIM_Config in this directory which
points to the installed KIM API library.  When the KIM API is built, this file
is created automatically.  If the file already exists, you can probably skip
this step.

Assuming an installed-(nonstandard)-build and that the KIM API bin directory
has been added to the path.

$ kim-api-v1-build-config --makefile-kim-config > Makefile.KIM_Config

Next, you can execute:

$ make all-system

or

$ make all-user

These will build and install (to the system or user collection, respectively)
all example Model Drivers, then Models.  It will also build the example
Simulators and Tests.

Once this is complete, you can use the example Simulator and Tests, inplace.
For example,

$ cd openkim_tests/utility_forces_numer_deriv
$ printf "ex_model_Ar_P_Morse" | ./utility_forces_numer_deriv
