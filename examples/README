This directory (examples) contains directories with example Model Drivers,
Models, and Simulators.  Please see the README files within each directory for
information about the examples.

To build and install these examples:

(Assuming the KIM API has previously been installed and that the KIM API bin
directory is on the path.)

$ make all-user

This will build and install (to the user collection) all example Model Drivers,
then Models.  It will also build the example Simulators.

Once this is complete, you can use the example Simulator inplace.  For example,

$ cd simulators/utility_forces_numer_deriv
$ printf "ex_model_Ar_P_Morse" | ./utilityforces_numer_deriv
