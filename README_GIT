============================= The KIM API package =============================

This file provides supplemental information for users who want to work with the
KIM API package through github.com and the git revision control program.

There are only a couple of significant differences between the source tarball
files that are distributed as kim-api-vX.Y.Z.txz and the kim-api git
repository.

1. The primary difference is that in the git repository there are no example
   Models, Model Drivers, Simulators, or OpenKIM Tests in the examples
   directory.  Instead the user must generate the examples by the following
   process:

   % cd ${KD}/examples/example_legos
   % make

   This will cobble together the example files form the various fragments
   stored in the ${KD}/examples/example_legos/model_legos,
   ${KD}/examples/example_legos/simulators_legos, and
   ${KD}/examples/example_legos/openkim_test_legos directories and save them in
   the ${KD}/examples/models/, ${KD}/examples/model_drivers/,
   ${KD}/examples/simulators, and ${KD}/examples/openkim_tests/ directories,
   respectively.  It also generates the templates in ${KD}/docs/templates.
   This need only be done once (for every time the git repository is updated
   from github.com).  This process will overwrite any changes to files, so make
   a backup of these directories if you don't want to lose your changes.

   It is also possible to remove all of these files using the

   % make clean

   command.  This command wraps the 'git clean' utility for just the specific
   directories mentioned above.

2. The git repository has the files:

      ${KD}/docs/kim-api-introduction.pdf
      ${KD}/docs/kim-api-introduction.pptx

   whereas the kim-api-vX.Y.Z.txz package has the file

      ${KD}/docs/kim-api-vX.Y.Z-introduction.pdf

3. The kim-api-vX.Y.Z.txz package has the file

      ${KD}/kim-api.release.info

   which contains the SHA1 Hash value of the git commit object from which the
   package was created, along with the date, time, and user name and email
   address of the person who created the package.

4. The git repository has the directory:

      ${KD}/scripts

   which contains the scripts used by the package maintainers to create
   official release tarballs.
