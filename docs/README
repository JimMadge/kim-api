Depending on how you obtained the kim-api package, this directory has 3 or 3
sub-directories and a PDF file:

porting-content-from-v1-to-v2-examples     example codes
src         content files for kim-api documentation
html        HTML version of the kim-api documentation (see html/index.html)
refman.pdf  PDF version of the kim-api documentation

If you downloaded the kim-api package as a tarball, all these directories and
files should be included.

If you cloned the kim-api git repository, then the HTML and PDF files are not
included.  Instead you need to create them by typing "make" followed by "make
pdf".  Note that this requires that the Doxygen tool is installed on your
system.  Further, "make pdf" requires that your system has a full LaTeX
distribution installed.

---------------------

The generation of all documenation is managed by the Makefile in this directory.

Options:

make         # generate HTML (in ./html) and LaTeX source (in ./latex)
make pdf     # generate refman.pdf (from source in ./latex)
make clean   # remove ./html ./latex and ./refman.pdf

---------------------

Once the HTML documenation has been generated, you can point your web browser
at ./html/index.html to view the documentation.
