\mainpage Introduction:

This page provides an introduction to the %KIM API package.

\par

Atomistic or molecular simulations of materials have the potential to play a
key role in the development of innovative technology to address many problems
the world is currently facing (including climate change, energy generation and
distribution, and terrorism).  Recent examples, where valuable contributions
and greater insight have been obtained, include applications in chemistry and
organic chemistry, nanoindentation and tribology, materials processing and
properties, and nanotechnology and nanofluidics.  To model the large numbers of
particles required for many applications, and to be able to study their
dynamics over reasonable time scales, it is generally necessary to develop
approximate models of interatomic bonding, referred to as "interatomic
potentials" or "interatomic models".  Once such a model is at hand, one can in
principle predict almost any mechanical property (and some thermal properties)
of the element (or elements) it purports to describe.  Generally, these models
define the forces and energies used for sophisticated simulations using
methodologies such as molecular dynamics, Monte Carlo, lattice dynamics free
energy methods, and multiscale methods. From such simulations, complex material
properties and phenomena can be extracted, including such things as melting
temperatures, solid-liquid interface phenomena, fracture properties, and
dislocation nucleation and motion.

The %KIM API software package is an implementation of the application
programming interface (API) standard for interatomic models developed as part
of the Knowledgebase of Interatomic Models (%KIM) project.  %KIM
(https://openkim.org) is a current initiative to develop and implement
standards for the atomistic simulation of materials.  The effort aims to help
bring order to the efforts of the academic, research, and industry communities
and to make it easier for new (and existing) scientists to leverage the work of
others in this important field.  The OpenKIM project has several main
objectives:

1. Development of an online open resource for standardized testing and
   long-term warehousing of interatomic models (potentials and force fields)
   and data.

2. Development of an API standard for atomistic simulations, which will allow
   any interatomic model to work seamlessly with any atomistic simulation code.

3. Fostering the development of a quantitative theory of transferability of
   interatomic models to provide guidance for selecting application-appropriate
   models based on rigorous criteria, and error bounds on results.

4. Striving for the permanence of the %KIM project, including development of a
   sustainability plan, and establishment of a long-term home for its content.

See \ref the_kim_api_package for a description of the features and capabilities
of the %KIM API.
