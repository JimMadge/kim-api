============================= The KIM API package =============================

This directory contains template files for creating new KIM-Compliant Model
Drivers and Models.  See the instructions below on how to use these files.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

STEP 1

Start by reviewing the contents of this directory.  It contains the following
files:

Makefile.Model.template
     A template for the Makefile that needs to be placed in a new Model
     directory.

Makefile.ModelDriver.template
     A template for the Makefile that needs to be placed in a new Model
     Driver directory.

Makefile.ParameterizedModel.template
     A template for the Makefile that needs to be placed in a new Model
     directory for Parameterized Models.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

STEP 2

Next, we take a first look at the templates.

The templates are designed to facilitate the creation of new KIM-Compliant
Model Drivers and Models.  As a first step, we suggest that you compare the
templates with functioning KIM Models provided with this KIM API release.  This
will allow you to see what changes are needed to turn the templates into
Models.  Detailed directions are also given below.

(a) The template `model_El_P_Template.c' can be compared with
    `ex_model_Ar_P_MLJ_C.c'.

(b) The template `model_El_P_Template.F03' can be compared with
    `ex_model_Ar_P_MLJ_F03.F03'.

(c) The template `model_El_PF_Template.F03' can be compared with
    `ex_model_Al_PF_ErcolessiAdams.F03'.

(d) The template `model_El_PF_Template.c' can be compared with
    `ex_model_Cu_PF_Johnson.c'.

(e) The template `model_driver_P_Template.F03' can be compared with
    `ex_model_driver_P_LJ.F03'

(f) The template `model_driver_P_Template.c' can be compared with
    `ex_model_driver_P_Morse.c'

Recall that Model Drivers are stored under ${KD}/examples/model_drivers and
Models are stored under ${KD}/examples/models.  To compare files, you can for
example use the `vimdiff' command:

   % cd ${KD}
   % vimdiff examples/models/ex_model_Ar_P_MLJ_F03/ex_model_Ar_P_MLJ_F03.F03 docs/templates/model_El_P_Template.F03

Alternatively use the excellent `ediff' feature of the emacs editor.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

STEP 3

You are now ready to create a new KIM-Compliant Model based on the provided
templates.

The directions below show how to use the Fortran 2003 template for a pair
potential (model_El_P_Template.F03) and turn it into a Model for argon (Ar)
using a Buckingham potential.  (The procedure for a Model written in C is
essentially identical. See comments below.)

(a) Create a new directory under MODELS for the Ar pair potential:

    % cd ${KD}/src/models
    % mkdir model_Ar_P_Buckingham

(b) Copy the .F03, .kim and Makefile templates into the new directory and
    rename:

    % cd ${KD}/src/models/model_Ar_P_Buckingham
    % cp ${KD}/docs/templates/model_El_P_Template.F03 model_Ar_P_Buckingham.F03
    % cp ${KD}/docs/templates/model_El_P_Template.f.kim model_Ar_P_Buckingham.kim
    % cp ${KD}/docs/templates/Makefile.Model.template Makefile

    Note: For a Model written in C, copy the .c and .c.kim templates.

(c) Edit the .kim file and enter the species.  (Search for the word "FILL"
    which indicates where changes are necessary.)  Also, change the "Release:"
    line to indicate that the file is part of your new Model and not part of
    the kim-api release.  To edit a file on a unix machine, use for example:

    % pico model_Ar_P_Buckingham.kim

(d) Edit the .F03 (or .c) file making all necessary changes.  (Search for the
    word "FILL".)  The main changes are:

    - The "Release:" line should be changed from referencing the kim-api
      release to something more appropriate.

    - Model name which appears in several places in the file.

    - Fill in the Model cutoff radius.

    - Define static parameters if necessary.  If these parameters need to be
      accessed outside the module (as in the _init() routine) add them to the
      list of public variables at the top of the module.

      Note: A Model cannot rely on static storage between calls.  A basic
      assumption in the KIM API is that *all* information needed by a Model to
      run is stored in the KIM API object.  This is necessary to allow multiple
      instances of the same Model being used simultaneously (see the Test
      `ex_test_Ar_multiple_models' for an example of such usage).  The only
      case where static variables can be used is if they are "hard-wired" so
      that the Model can only work with those constant values.  In Fortran this
      is done using the "parameter" statement.  In C, use preprocessor
      `#define' statements.  Otherwise variables need to be stored as
      PARAM_FREE_ or PARAM_FIXED_ variables in the KIM API object.
      Alternatively you can use the "model buffer" feature of the KIM API to
      store a pointer to a data structure.  See the discussion in the
      standard.kim file.

    - Fill in the necessary code in the routines calc_phi() and calc_phi_dphi().

    - Add any necessary initialization into the _init() routine.

(e) Edit the Makefile and change the Model name, the name of the Model's ".kim"
    file, and model_init function values appropriately.  Add the Model's object
    file (model_Ar_P_Buckingham.o) to the LOCALOBJ line.  In this example the
    LOCALCLEAN line can be left blank.  (Search for the word "FILL" to find the
    locations in the file that need to be edited.)  Also change the "Release:"
    line to indicate that the file is part of your new Model and not part of
    the kim-api release.

(f) Compile the new Model into the KIM API package:

    % cd ${KD}
    % make

    Correct any errors until the compilation succeeds.

(g) You can now run Simulators that are compatible with your Model simply by
    giving your new Model name as an argument.

    Note: If you run a Simulator and it does not seem to be working, remember
          to check the kim.log file for any messages.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

STEP 4

In STEP 3, you created a KIM-Compliant Model for Ar based on the Buckingham
functional form.  You will now see how you can create a Buckingham Model Driver
and the specific Model for Ar by specifying the appropriate parameters.  The
Model Driver approach has the advantage that once the Model Driver is created
it is easy to create many Models that use this form for different materials or
even different parameterizations for the same material.

The directions for using the supplied templates to create a new KIM-Compliant
Buckingham Model Driver and a Ne KIM Model based on it are given below.

(a) Create a new directory under src/model_drivers for the Buckingham pair
    potential Model Driver:

    % cd ${KD}/src/model_drivers
    % mkdir model_driver_P_Buckingham

(b) Copy the .F03, .kim and Makefile templates into the new directory and
    rename:

    % cd ${KD}/src/model_drivers/model_driver_P_Buckingham
    % cp ${KD}/docs/templates/model_driver_P_Template.F03 model_driver_P_Buckingham.F03
    % cp ${KD}/docs/templates/model_driver_P_Template.f.kim.tpl model_driver_P_Buckingham.kim.tpl
    % cp ${KD}/docs/templates/Makefile.ModelDriver.template Makefile

    Note: For a Model written in C, copy the .c and .c.kim.tpl templates.

(c) Edit the .kim.tpl file and define the parameters used by this Model Driver.
    (Search for the word "FILL" which indicates where changes are necessary.)
    Also change the "Release:" line to indicate that the file is part of your
    new Model and not part of the kim-api release.  To edit a file on a unix
    machine, use for example:

    % pico model_driver_Buckingham.kim.tpl

(d) Edit the .F03 (or .c) file making all necessary changes.  (Search for the
    word "FILL".)  The main changes are:

    - The "Release:" line should be changed from referencing the kim-api
      release to something more appropriate.

    - Model Driver name which appears in several places in the file.

    - Fill in the Model Driver parameters which are required in several places
      in the file.

    - Fill in the necessary code in the routines calc_phi() and calc_phi_dphi().

    - Specify the format for reading in the parameter data (in Fortran 2003 you
      can simply set this to `*'.)

(e) Edit the Makefile and change the Model Driver name, Model Driver ".kim.tpl"
    template file name, and model_init function values appropriately.  Add the
    Model's object file (model_driver_P_Buckingham.o) to the LOCALOBJ line.  In
    this example the LOCALCLEAN line can be left blank.  (Search for the word
    "FILL".)  Also change the "Release:" line to indicate that the file is part
    of your new Model and not part of the kim-api release.

(f) Compile the new Model Driver into the API package:

    % cd ${KD}
    % make

    Correct any errors until the compilation succeeds.

(g) Create a new directory under src/models for the Ne pair potential:

    % cd ${KD}/src/models
    % mkdir model_Ne_P_Buckingham

(h) Copy the `Makefile.ParameterizedModel.template' and
    model_El_P_Template.params files into the new directory and rename:

    % cd ${KD}/src/models/model_Ne_P_Buckingham
    % cp ${KD}/docs/templates/Makefile.ParameterizedModel.template Makefile
    % cp ${KD}/docs/templates/model_El_P_Template.params model_Ne_P_Buckingham.params

(i) Edit the Makefile and change the Model name, Model Driver name,
    SPECIES_001_NAME, and Parameter file name appropriately. (Search for the
    word "FILL".)  Also change the "Release:" line to indicate that the file is
    part of your new Model and not part of the kim-api release.

(j) Edit the model_Ne_P_Buckingham.params file appropriately. (Search for the
     word "FILL".)  Also change the "Release:" line to indicate that the file
     is part of your new Model and not part of the kim-api release.

(k)  Compile the new Model into the KIM API package:

     % cd ${KD}
     % make

     Correct any errors until the compilation succeeds.

(l)  You can now run Simulators that are compatible with your Model simply by
     giving your new Model name as an argument.

     Note: If you run a Simulator and it does not seem to be working, remember
           to check the kim.log file for any messages.
