============================= The KIM API package =============================

This file provides an introduction to the KIM API package.  This is the first
file that you should read after unpacking the package.  See the INSTALL file
for instructions on how to build and install the package

OVERVIEW:

Atomistic or molecular simulations of materials have the potential to play a
key role in the development of innovative technology to address many problems
the world is currently facing (including climate change, energy generation and
distribution, and terrorism).  Recent examples, where valuable contributions
and greater insight have been obtained, include applications in chemistry and
organic chemistry, nanoindentation and tribology, materials processing and
properties, and nanotechnology and nanofluidics.  To model the large numbers of
particles required for many applications, and to be able to study their
dynamics over reasonable time scales, it is generally necessary to develop
approximate models of interatomic bonding, referred to as "interatomic
potentials" or "interatomic models".  Once such a model is at hand, one can in
principle predict almost any mechanical property (and some thermal properties)
of the element (or elements) it purports to describe.  Generally, these models
define the forces and energies used for sophisticated simulations using
methodologies such as molecular dynamics, Monte Carlo, lattice dynamics free
energy methods, and multiscale methods. From such simulations, complex material
properties and phenomena can be extracted, including such things as melting
temperatures, solid-liquid interface phenomena, fracture properties, and
dislocation nucleation and motion.

This software package is an implementation of the application programming
interface (API) standard for interatomic models developed as part of the Open
Knowledgebase of Interatomic Models (OpenKIM) project.  OpenKIM
(https://openkim.org) is a current initiative to develop and implement
standards for the atomistic simulation of materials.  The effort aims to help
bring order to the efforts of the academic, research, and industry
communities and to make it easier for new (and existing) scientists to leverage
the work of others in this important field.  The OpenKIM project has several
main objectives:

1. Development of an online open resource for standardized testing and
   long-term warehousing of interatomic models (potentials and force fields)
   and data.

2. Development of an API standard for atomistic simulations, which will allow
   any interatomic model to work seamlessly with any atomistic simulation code.

3. Fostering the development of a quantitative theory of transferability of
   interatomic models to provide guidance for selecting application-appropriate
   models based on rigorous criteria, and error bounds on results.

4. Striving for the permanence of the KIM project, including development of a
   sustainability plan, and establishment of a long-term home for its content.


THE KIM API PACKAGE:

The KIM API package is a system-level library that aims to give computer
programmers the ability to write atomistic or molecular simulation programs
that can seamlessly interface with implementations of interatomic models,
regardless of the programming language (C, C++, FORTRAN 77, Fortran 90/95/2003,
Python, etc.) in which the codes are written.

This version of the KIM API package is distributed under the CDDL Open Source
License.

The current version of the KIM API package supports the following features:

* Currently supported programming languages:
  C, C++, FORTRAN 77, Fortran 90/95, Fortran 2003.

* Support for automatic translation between zero-based numbering (C-style
  numbering beginning with 0) and one-based numbering (Fortran-style numbering
  beginning with 1) of particles.

* Communication of an arbitrary number of `arguments' between a `Model'
  (interatomic potential) and a `Simulator' (simulation code that uses a
  Model).

* Data types: integer and double.

  Each of the data types can be used to create multi-dimensional array
  `arguments' that are exchanged between Models and Simulators.  The KIM API
  standard defines the dimension and extent of these arrays for each argument.
  However, this information is not discoverable at run-time.  Thus, it is left
  to the programmer to ensure that the correct values are used.

  Currently, the KIM API does not define any (more complex) data structures.
  However, in the future (as the need arises, and in consultation with the
  atomistic and molecular simulation community) additional data types and data
  structures may be introduced.

* Physical Units: The KIM API standard defines the physical units for each
  `argument' exchanged between a Model and Simulator.  A simulator provides a
  set of `requested units' to define a unit system and a model either accepts
  this unit system (and makes appropriate unit converstions for its
  parameters), or it rejects the request and reports the unit system it uses.

* Neighbor list routines are expected to be provided by the calling Simulator.
  All neighbor lists are full, unsorted lists that must contain all particles
  within the specified cutoff distance (but may contain additional particles).
  A model may request any number of such lists, each with a different cutoff
  distance.  A simulator must provide all such requested lists.

* Particle Species: The KIM API provides the ability to designate the physical
  species of each particle in a simulation.  Currently, only one identifier is
  provided for each element in the periodic table.  In the future support for
  Models that require multiple types of each element may be added.

* Model Parameters: The OpenKIM philosophy views a `Model' as a well-defined
  computational code that includes fixed specific values for all parameters
  needed to perform an actual computation.  However, it is often useful to
  explore how a Model's predictions vary as the values of its parameters are
  varied.  For this reason, the KIM API provides the ability for a Model to
  `publish' its parameters so that a Simulator may modify them during the
  course of a simulation.

* Model Drivers: The KIM API package provides the ability to create Model
  Driver routines.  A Model for a given material can be created from a Model
  Driver by providing a file or files with the appropriate parameter values for
  the material of interest.

For more details on the difference between version 1 and version 2 of the
kim-api package, see the file `docs/README-V2'.

Your next step after reading this file is to install the KIM API package.  See
the detailed instructions in the INSTALL file in this directory.
